      <h2>Hydroelectric Power</h2><br><br>
      <p><li>	Hydropower is non-polluting, but does have environmental impacts.
         Hydropower facilities can affect land use, homes, and natural habitats in the dam area.
        Reservoirs may cover people’s homes, important natural areas, agricultural land, and archaeological sites.</li><br>
        <li>Hydroelectricity is hydrology dependent.
          The system depends on precipitation levels, which can fluctuate from year to year, causing instability.</li><br>
          <li>In some cases, hydroelectricity can disrupt wildlife habitat.
            Hydroelectric power plants can cause a loss or modification of fish habitat,
            and lead to the entrapment of fish and the restriction of their passages.</li><br>
            <li>In some cases, hydroelectricity can cause changes in reservoir and stream water quality.
               Operating a hydroelectric power plant may alter the water temperature and the river’s flow.
               These changes may harm native plants and animals in the river and on land and can kill the river.</li><br>

        <p><h2>Wind Energy</h2><br><br>
        <li>Aesthetic impact: Many people are concerned
          with the visual effects that wind turbines have on the beautiful scenery of nature.
          They believe that giant wind turbines distract viewers from the beautiful surroundings. </li><br>
          <li>Wildlife: Wind turbines may be dangerous to flying animals.
             Many birds and bats have been killed by flying into the rotors.
             Experts are now conducting research to learn more about the effects that wind turbines have on marine habitats.</li>
           <br>	<li>Remoteness of location: Although this may be an advantage (placing wind turbines in desolate areas,
                far away from people), it may also be a disadvantage.
                The cost of travel and maintenance on the turbines increases and is time consuming.
               Offshore wind turbines require boats and can be dangerous to manage.</li><br>
               <li>Noise: Some wind turbines tend to generate a lot of noise which can be unpleasant</
                 li><br>
               <li>Safety at Sea: In the darkness/at night it may be difficult
                 for incoming boats to see wind turbines thus leading to collisions.</li><br>

      <h2>Geothermal Energy </h2><br><br>
      <li>Potential emissions – Greenhouse gas below Earth’s surface can potentially migrate to the surface and into the atmosphere.
        Such emissions tend to be higher near geothermal power plants, which are associated with sulfur dioxide and silica emissions.
        Also, and the reservoirs can contain traces of toxic heavy metals including mercury, arsenic and boron.</li><br>
        <li>Surface Instability – Construction of geothermal power plants can affect
          the stability of land. In January 1997,
          the construction of a geothermal power plant in Switzerland triggered an earthquake with
          a magnitude of 3.4 on the Richter scale.</li><br>
          <li>High cost for electricity – Total costs usually end up somewhere
            between $2 – 7 million for a 1 MW geothermal power plant.</li><br>
            <li>High up-front costs for heating and cooling systems –
               While there is a predictable ROI, it will not happen quickly.For an average sized home,
               installation of geothermal heat pumps costs between
              $10,000 – $20,000 which can pay off itself in another 5-10 years down the line</li><br>
              <li>Location Specific: Geothermal reservoirs need to be placed faraway from populated areas.</li><br>
              <li>Distribution costs – If geothermal energy is transported long distances, cost can become prohibitive.</li><br><br>

        <h2>Biomass</h2><br><br>
        <li>The potential of biomass energy is there for all to see.
          It is a carbon neutral fuel source that offers lower costs that fossil fuels, while also being extremely diverse.
          However, there are many issues that are holding it back from wider adoption.
          In particular, more needs to be done to solve the issue of efficiency as a fuel,
          plus issues like space and cost need to be considered.</li><br>
          <li>High Costs In Comparison To Other Alternatives - While the cost of extracting biomass fuels is lower than most types of fossil fuels,
            they still generally exceed those of many other forms of renewable energy.
            In some cases, biomass projects are considered not to be worth the price of completion,
            especially when solar, water and wind alternatives are available.
            This cost comes from the need of biomass resources to be maintained,
            and for extracted biomass to be replanted.
            Furthermore, the cost of the machinery used in extraction is also a factor,
            as it transportation of the biomass.</li><br>
