			<h2>Solar skin design</h2>
			<p style="font-size: 15px;">
				One major barrier for the solar industry is the fact that a high
				percentage of homeowners consider solar panels to be an unsightly
				home addition. Luckily, one new venture has a solution. Sistine Solar,
				a Boston-based design firm, is making major strides with the concept of
				aesthetic enhancement that allow solar panels to have a customized look.
				The MIT startup has created a “solar skin” product that makes it possible
				for solar panels to match the appearance of a roof without interfering
				with panel efficiency or production. Sistine Solar’s skin product was
				expected to hit U.S. markets in 2018 and will help to rebrand solar
				panels as a luxury product, not just a home efficiency upgrade.

      <h2>Wearable solar</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">
        Though wearable solar devices are nothing new (solar-powered watches
        and other gadgets have been on the market for several years), the past
        few years saw an innovation in solar textiles: tiny solar panels can
        now be stitched into the fabric of clothing. The wearable solar products
        of the past, like solar-powered watches, have typically been made with
        hard plastic material. This new textile concept makes it possible for
        solar to expand into home products like window curtains and dynamic
        consumer clean tech like heated car seats. This emerging solar technology
        is credited to textile designer Marianne Fairbanks and chemist Trisha Andrew.

      <p style="font-size: 15px;">
        Last summer paved the way for tests of an exciting new PV technology –
        solar powered roads. The sidewalks along Route 66, America’s historic
        interstate highway, were chosen as the testing location for
        solar-powered pavement tech. These roadways are heralded for their
        ability to generate clean energy, but they also include LED bulbs that
        can light roads at night and have the thermal heating capacity to melt
        snow during winter weather. The next stop following sidewalk tests is
        to install these roadways on designated segments of Route 66.

      <h2>Solar batteries: innovation in solar storage</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 15px;">
        The concepts of off-grid solar and solar plus storage have gained
        popularity in U.S. markets, and solar manufacturers have taken notice.
        The industry-famous Tesla Powerwall, a rechargelithium-ionm ion battery
        product launched in 2015, continues to lead the pack with regard to
        market share and brand recognition for solar batteries.  Tesla offers
        two storage products, the Powerwall for residential use and the Powerpack
        for commercial use, and the clean auto behemoth is expected to launch
        its Powerwall 2.0 product in weeks to come. Solar storage is still a
        fairly expensive product in 2019, but a surge in demand from solar
        shoppers is expected to bring significantly more efficient and affordable
        batteries to market in 2019.
