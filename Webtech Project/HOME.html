				<hr>
				<br><br>
				<p>Cochin International Airport in Kerala is setting example for the rest of the world
					by contributing towards the environment.
					It is the first ever fully solar powered airport with an inauguration dedicated solar plant.

					Moreover, the airport is going one step ahead by generating electricity with eight small
					hydroelectric power projects
					and organic vegetation in the vicinity of the airport.

					Recently, UN Environment head Erik Solheim visited the Cochin Airport to tap the back of the authorities
					who are running these many projects. <br><br> <a href="http://www.solardaily.com/">Visit SolarDaily for more news</a></p>

					<h1>What is Solar Energy?</h1>
			 	<br><br><br> <p>Solar energy works by capturing the sunâ€™s energy and turning it into
						 	electricity for your home or business.<br>
					<br> <p>	Our sun is a natural nuclear reactor.
					 		It releases tiny packets of energy called photons,
							which travel the 93 million miles from the sun to Earth in about 8.5 minutes.
							Every hour, enough photons impact our planet to generate enough
						 	solar energy to theoretically satisfy global energy needs for an entire year.

					<h1>How solar energy works?</h1><br><br><br>
					<p>In most solar systems, solar panels are placed on the roof.
						An ideal site will have no shade on the panels, especially during the prime sunlight hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.;
						a south-facing installation will usually provide the optimum potential for your system,
						but other orientations may provide sufficient production.
						Trees or other factors that cause shading during the day will cause significant decreases to power production.
						The importance of shading and efficiency cannot be overstated.
						In a solar panel, if even just one of its 36 cells is shaded,
						power production will be reduced by more than half.
						Experienced installation contractors such as NW Wind & Solar use a device called
						a Solar Pathfinder to carefully identify potential areas of shading prior to installation.

					<h1>Why Solar Energy?</h1> <br><br><br>
					<p>There is a reason why solar energy has become a trending topic when talking about renewables.
						While it has been widely criticised for being expensive or not very efficient,
						solar energy has now proved to be extremely beneficial - not only for the environment but also financially speaking.
						Additionally, due to the higher demand, the technology has been improved considerably,
						turning into a significantly efficient source of clean energy.
