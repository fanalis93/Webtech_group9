    <h2>About Solarify</h2>
    <p>
      This website is being started with the intention to provide information about the cleanest energy provider,
       solar energy and why this energy should be used. This website can be used categories and types of solar energy generators.
  The motive of this project is to introduce people to solar energy and perhaps motivate the audience to use it.
   This website can be a minim contribution to achieve an eco-friendly world for us and the future generations and to preserve our mother nature.

        What is Solar Energy?
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section section-dark">
              <p>Solar energy works by capturing the sun’s energy and turning it into
              electricity for your home or business.<br>

              Our sun is a natural nuclear reactor.
              It releases tiny packets of energy called photons,
              which travel the 93 million miles from the sun to Earth in about 8.5 minutes.
              Every hour, enough photons impact our planet to generate enough
              solar energy to theoretically satisfy global energy needs for an entire year.

        How solar energy works?

  <section class="section section-dark">
            <p>In most solar systems, solar panels are placed on the roof.
            An ideal site will have no shade on the panels, especially during the prime sunlight hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.;
            a south-facing installation will usually provide the optimum potential for your system,
            but other orientations may provide sufficient production.
            Trees or other factors that cause shading during the day will cause significant decreases to power production.
            The importance of shading and efficiency cannot be overstated.
            In a solar panel, if even just one of its 36 cells is shaded,
            power production will be reduced by more than half.
            Experienced installation contractors such as NW Wind & Solar use a device called
            a Solar Pathfinder to carefully identify potential areas of shading prior to installation.

        Why Solar Energy?

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <p>There is a reason why solar energy has become a trending topic when talking about renewables.
            While it has been widely criticised for being expensive or not very efficient,
            solar energy has now proved to be extremely beneficial - not only for the environment but also financially speaking.
            Additionally, due to the higher demand, the technology has been improved considerably,
            turning into a significantly efficient source of clean energy.
