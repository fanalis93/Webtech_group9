      <button class="accordion"><p>
1. What are the financial benefits of solar energy?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you install a solar energy system on your property, you save money on your electricity bills and protect yourself against rising electricity rates in the future. How much you can save depends on the utility rates and solar policies in your area, but going solar is a smart investment regardless of where you live.</p>

</div>

<button class="accordion"><p>
2. What are the environmental benefits of solar energy?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Solar power, like other renewable energy resources, has many environmental and health benefits. Going solar reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change, and also results in fewer air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, which can cause health problems.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><p>3. How do solar photovoltaic (PV) panels work?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Solar panels absorb the sun's energy throughout the day and convert it into direct current (DC) electricity. Most homes and businesses run on alternating current (AC) electricity, so the DC electricity is then passed through an inverter to convert it to usable AC electricity. At that point, you either use the electricity in your house or send it back to the electric grid.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><p>
4. Do solar panels work in a blackout?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>If your solar panel system is connected to the grid, it will shut off in the event of a blackout. This is to prevent emergency responders and electricity utility repair-people from being injured by your panels sending power back to the grid. However, there are certain inverters you can buy that provide backup power in a blackout when paired with a battery.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><p>5. Can I go off grid with solar panels?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you install solar panels on your property, you will still be connected to the grid. This allows you to draw from the grid when your system is not producing all of the power that you need, and send power back to the grid when you produce more than you use. It is possible to go off the grid with a solar energy system that includes battery storage, but it will cost significantly more and is unnecessary for the majority of homeowners.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion"><p>6. How is this different from rooftop solar?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>When you buy into a community solar project, you receive a portion of the energy generated by a large solar panel system that is located elsewhere in your area. Unlike a home solar panel system, a community solar project isn’t installed on your roof. Community solar and rooftop solar both result in net savings on your electricity bill, but each offers distinct benefits. Compare them to find the right one for you.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><p>7. How does it save me money?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Community solar saves you money by allowing you to invest in solar panels that produce electricity for your home or business, even when you can’t install them on your roof. When you participate in a community solar project, you are paying for access to less expensive solar electricity so that you don’t have to buy electricity at standard utility rates.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><p>8. What happens if there is snow on solar panels?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Solar panels convert sunshine into power, so if your panels are covered in snow they can’t produce electricity. Snow generally isn’t heavy enough to cause structural issues with your panels, and since most panels are tilted at an angle the snow will slide off. If snow does accumulate, your panels are easy to clean.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><p>9. How Long Do Solar Panels Last?</p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Most manufacturers give 20-25 year warranty but If solar panels are installed and maintained properly, you can expect them to last and produce good amount of electricity for up to 35-40 years.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion"><p>10. How do I know if I have enough sunlight for PV? </p></button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>A photovoltaic (PV) system needs unobstructed access to the sun's rays for most or all of the day. Shading on the system can significantly reduce energy output. Climate is not really a concern, because PV systems are relatively unaffected by severe weather. In fact, some PV modules actually work better in colder weather. Most PV modules are angled to catch the sun's rays, so any snow that collects on them usually melts quickly. There is enough sunlight to make solar energy systems useful and effective nearly everywhere in California. </p>
