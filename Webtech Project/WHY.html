			<p>	There is a reason why solar energy has become a trending topic when talking about renewables.
				 	While it has been widely criticised for being expensive or not very efficient,
				 	solar energy has now proved to be extremely beneficial - not only for the environment but also financially speaking.
				  Additionally, due to the higher demand, the technology has been improved considerably,
					turning into a significantly efficient source of clean energy.<br>

				<br><br>	<strong>Renewable</strong><br><br>
					Solar panels produce electricity by transforming the continuous flow of energy from the sun to electricity.
					<br><br> <strong>CO₂-free</strong><br><br>
					No harmful emissions are released into the air when electricity is produced by solar panels.
				<br><br>	<strong>Low operating costs</strong><br><br>
					The photovoltaic process that transforms sunlight into electricity doesn’t require any fuel and has no variable costs.
				<br><br>	<strong>Limitless solar energy</strong><br><br>
					The sun provides more than enough energy to meet the whole world’s energy needs,
					and unlike fossil fuels, it won’t run out anytime soon.
					As a renewable energy source, the only limitation of solar power is our ability to turn it into electricity in an efficient and cost-effective way.

				<br><br>	<strong>	Solar energy - a clean source</strong><br><br>
					No greenhouse gas emissions are released into the atmosphere when you use solar panels to create electricity.
					And because the sun provides more energy than we’ll ever need,
					electricity from solar power is a very important energy source in the move to clean energy production.

				<br><br>	<strong>No fuel to burn</strong><br><br>
					After solar panels have been installed, operational costs are quite low compared to other forms of power generation.
					Fuel isn’t required, and this means that solar power can create large amounts of electricity without the uncertainty and expense of securing a fuel supply.
