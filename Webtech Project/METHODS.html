			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<p>
				There are two main types of solar technology: photovoltaics (PV)
				and concentrated solar power (CSP). Solar PV technology captures
				sunlight to generate electric power, and CSP harnesses the sun’s
				heat and uses it to generate thermal energy that powers heaters
				or turbines. With these two forms of solar energy comes a wide
				range of opportunities for technical innovation.

					<p>Photovoltaics is the science behind the most popular form of harnessing solar energy.
						It is the process of converting sunlight directly into electricity. The photovoltaic (PV)
						effect was first observed in 1839. However, it wasn’t until 1954 that scientists were
						able to discover exactly how it works.
						Historically, space programs were the largest supporters of PV technology, since the system was the
						best energy source for their satellites. The industry has since grown and you have probably seen PV
						systems used to power electronics, cars, houses, commercial buildings, and to supplement power grids.
						Due to increased efficiency, decreasing cost and increased environmental concern, photovoltaic
						installations have increased dramatically in recent years.</p>

					<p style="border-bottom: 2px solid red; padding-top: 10px ">Power tower or central receiver systems utilize sun-tracking mirrors called heliostats
						to focus sunlight onto a receiver at the top of a tower. A heat transfer fluid heated in
						the receiver up to around 600ºC is used to generate steam, which, in turn, is used in a
						conventional turbine-generator to produce electricity.

						Early power towers, such as the Solar One plant, utilized steam as the heat transfer fluid;
						current designs use molten salts because of superior heat transfer and energy storage capabilities.
						Some other designs use air as heat transfer medium because of its high temperature and
						its good handability.</p>
